To start with, we allow only sequential models. In addition, given our knowledge of the application (image classification), we impose a rigid structure on the network.

The bottom part consists of a combination of convolutional and maxpooling layers, and the top part consists of fully connected layers.

    "For both the random search algorithm and the hill climbing algorithm, our evaluation strategy was to evaluate each solution for only three epochs. We made the assumption that the resulting validation error would be a good indicator of how well the model would perform after more training. To get a more accurate evaluation of how well the best model actually performs, our final code snippet evaluates the best model for 20 epochs. If things go well, the achieved accuracy should be in line with what we achieved with the model described in c7e3_convnet_cifar_conf5 in Chapter 7.\n"
