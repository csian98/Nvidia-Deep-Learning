    "This code example demonstrates how an autoencoder can be used for outlier detection. We do this by first training an autoencoder on the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) dataset. Then we observe how the error is higher when the network is presented with an image that does not represent a handwritten digit. More context for this code example can be found in the section \"Programming Example: Autoencoder for outlier detection\" in Chapter 17 in the book Learning Deep Learning by Magnus Ekman (ISBN: 9780137470358).\n"

    "We start with a set of import statements, followed by loading the MNIST dataset. However, in this example we do not standardize the data. The reason is worth some discussion. The task for the autoencoder is to reproduce the input on its outputs. This implies that we need to define the input data and the output unit of the network in a way that makes this possible. For example, if we use input data centered around 0, and a logistic sigmoid as the output unit, then the network simply cannot solve the problem because the logistic sigmoid can output only positive values. When working with image data, we want the output range to be bounded to a range of valid values (typically integer values between 0 and 255 or floating-point values between 0 and 1). A common way to ensure this is to scale the input values to be between 0 and 1 and use a logistic sigmoid unit as output unit. Another alternative would be to center the input around 0 and use a linear output unit, but we would then need to postprocess the output data to ensure that they do not contain out-of-range values. In our case, we decided to work with input values between 0 and 1, and it turns out that this is the default range for MNIST in PyTorch. Therefore we do not need to scale the values.\n"

    "The next step is to define the model. This is shown in the code snippet below. The encoder part of the model consists of a Flatten layer (changing the dimension from 28×28 to 784) followed by a single fully connected (Dense) layer with 64 units. The decoder consists of another fully connected layer with 784 units, followed by a Reshape layer that changes the dimension from 784 to 28×28. That is, the decoder performs the inverse of the operations done by the encoder. The goal for the autoencoder is to generate an output image that is identical to the input image, and it has to do that by fully encoding the 28×28 (784) image in the intermediate representation vector of size 64.\n",

Looking at the code below, you can see how we discard the target values from the trainloader and testloader and set both the inputs and targets to the same value. We also modify the dimensionality of the data by calling the squeeze() method. This results in removing any dimension of value 1. We had to do this in order to make the targets match the exact dimensionality of the model output. There is a pitfall to be aware of when doing this.
